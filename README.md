# Roland JD-Xi MIDI Implementation - Plain Text Version

The official MIDI implementation documentation for the Roland JD-Xi comes as a PDF file in a two column format. Although more compact than this version, it is sometimes hard to read. I created this for myself and for others that might like it too, just to make it easier to read it. Perhaps I will also add some examples after some of the documented MIDI messages. Anyone is invited to contribute.

The first version only contains the first few sections as well as section 5. Parameter Address Map, which is what I am mostly interested in. I might add the other sections too, if I feel the urge.

The official documentation can be found here: http://www.rolandus.com/support/by_product/jd-xi/owners_manuals/350585

Enjoy!
