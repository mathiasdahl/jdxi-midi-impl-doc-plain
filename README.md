# Roland JD-Xi MIDI Implementation - Plain Text Version

The official MIDI implementation documentation for the Roland JD-Xi comes as a PDF file in a two column format. Although more compact than this version, it is sometimes hard to read. I created this for myself and for others that might like it too, just to make it easier to read it. Perhaps I will also add some examples after some of the documented MIDI messages. Anyone is invited to contribute.

Enjoy!
